# Facial-Mask-Detection-Using-Stacked-CNN-Model
## Deep Learning project : "Face Mask Detection based on Computer Vision".

The whole model is developed using tensorflow and applied CNN for creating the Face Mask Detector model 
through which multiple subjects can be checked at same time.

--> A method of building a Face Mask Detector using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Python, Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV. With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV or other types cameras to detect and identify people without masks. With the prevailing worldwide situation due to COVID-19 pandemic, these types of systems would be very supportive for many kind of institutions around the world.
